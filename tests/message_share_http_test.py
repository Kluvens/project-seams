message = '''Thus Spoke Zarathustra A Book for All and None
    When Zarathustra was thirty years old he left his home and the lake of his home 
    and went into the mountains. Here he enjoyed his spirit and his solitude and for 
    ten years he did not tire of it. But at last his heart transformed,  one morning 
    he arose with the dawn, stepped before the sun and spoke thus to it: 
    “You great star! What would your happiness be if you had not those for whom you shine 
    For ten years you have come up here to my cave: you would have tired of your light 
    and of this route without me, my eagle and my snake. But we awaited you every morning, 
    took your overflow from you and blessed you for it. Behold! I am weary of my wisdom, 
    like a bee that has gathered too much honey. I need hands that reach out. 
    I want to bestow and distribute until the wise among human beings have once again 
    enjoyed their folly, and the poor once again their wealth. For this I must descend into
    the depths, as you do evenings when you go behind the sea and bring light even to the 
    underworld, you super-rich star! Like you, I must go down as the human beings say, 
    to whom I want to descend. So bless me now, you quiet eye that can look upon even an 
    all too great happiness without envy! Bless the cup that wants to flow over, such that 
    water flows golden from it and everywhere carries the reflection of your bliss! 
    Behold! This cup wants to become empty again, and Zarathustra wants to become human again.”
    Thus began Zarathustras going under.'''
